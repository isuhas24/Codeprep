    <string name="backtracking_q1">Question 1:\n
        Consider a rat placed at (0, 0) in a square matrix of order N * N. It has to reach the destination at (N - 1, N - 1). Find all possible paths that the rat can take to reach from source to destination. The directions in which the rat can move are U(up), D(down), L(left), R(right). Value 0 at a cell in the matrix represents that it is blocked and rat cannot move to it while value 1 at a cell in the matrix represents that rat can be travel through it. Note: In a path, no cell can be visited more than one time. If the source cell is 0, the rat cannot move to any other cell.\n

        The rat can reach the destination at (3, 3) from (0, 0) by two paths - DRDDRR and DDRDRR, when printed in sorted order we get DDRDRR DRDDRR.\n

    <string name="stacks_and_queues_q2">Question 2:\n
        A celebrity is a person who is known to all but does not know anyone at a party. If you go to a party of N people, find if there is a celebrity in the party or not. A square NxN matrix M[][] is used to represent people at the party such that if an element of row i and column j  is set to 1 it means ith person knows jth person. Here M[i][i] will always be 0.\n
        Note: Follow 0 based indexing.\n
        <b>Input:</b>\n
        N = 3\n
        M[][] = {{0 1 0},\n
                {0 0 0}, \n
                {0 1 0}}\n
        <b>Output:</b> 1\n
        <b>Explanation:</b>\n
        0th and 2nd person both know 1. Therefore, 1 is the celebrity. \n
